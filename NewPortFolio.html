			<h2>My first projects (attempts, I would say...)</h2>
			<p>Let us be clear, for the first 4 projets, I didn't want to add my personal style. My only goal was to try to reproduce identical pages given for example by the FreeCodeCamp site and to fullfill the user stories. The 4 projects as well as this portfolio were realized only with html and css... Three months before, I didn’t know anything about these two "languages" more complex than it seems.<br>For this Portfolio, on the one hand, I added my personal touch (animation, graphism, fonts, mixing grid and flex ...) and, on the other hand, targeted the goal of 0 error and 0 warning in the HTML validation test on w3.org. I know that I am only at the beginning of the road but I have the firm intention to improve, by working hard, my skills. </p>

			<h2>A little bit About me</h2>
			<p>My name is Gilles PAYET and I am turning 53 years old very soon. I was born in Perigueux but I have lived near Toulouse since 1977. I am married and our two children are now mature and independent.<br>I work as a train driver but I will be soon dismissed for incapacity. Because of my age, I think it would be better to chose a new job, as far as possible, in accordance with my aspirations.<br>I’ve always been attracted to computer development and, several times, I dabbled coding (C++ then Java) but, may be wrongly, I thought it was impossible to reconsile my professional life, my family and this hobby whis is quite time-consuming.<br>Three months ago, I saw a television show featuring 50-year-olds in web development conversion and I said to myself "Why not me ?!?!". What if I made this hobby my next job !!! Especially since I had completed a skills assessment revealing good predispositions in this field.<br>And so, since this television show, I have been studying HTML5, CSS3 and Python3. I have fun with these passtime even it is sometimes difficult to understand and hard not to get confused. I take this adventure like a challenge. I have chosen this road and I intend to pursue it to the end - if there is one ;=).</p>
			<p>Professionally, I spent 10 years as an executive and operating manager in a rental business. Then 12 years self-employed as a manager of a small trading company. And currently, train driver in a french subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn. Yes, I know !!! My career path is not straight. I want to see it like an advantage. Through this path, I developed my abilities to adjust new jobs, my flexibility and cross-disciplinary competences.</p>
			<p>School curriculum : Bachelor's degree in mathematics and Philosophy (A1). Master's degree in history.</p>
